We are going to discuss the 8th step in the basic CFD formulation.
Burgers' equation is a fundamental nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) in fluid mechanics.
It has been derived from Navier's Stokes equation.
It models viscous flow and combines nonlinearity (convection) and diffusion.
Assumptions: Flow is 2-dimensional, unsteady, viscous effectsÂ are significant.
Applications:
Understanding turbulence and shock formation.
Validating numerical schemes for complex PDEs.
